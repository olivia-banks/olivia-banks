Hey, I'm Milo. I'm an applications and systems developer, with professional experience in C, C++, and Python. At my current job, I maintain interfaces to scientific simulation software, bindings, unit tests, and continuous integration solutions. Outside of the professional sphere, I'm proficient in Rust, Zig, Lua, and Perl. I've worked with Linux, macOS, and various BSDs.

## Personal Projects

I've moved over to [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~milobanks), and don't use this account much anymore. Mirrors are maintainted for projects I care more about. This is not a full list of all my personal projects, only the ones I would like to showcase here.

- [**Koi**](https://git.sr.ht/~milobanks/koi) ([GitHub Mirror](https://github.com/milobanks/koi))  
  A compiler and full toolchain, written in C, featuring a custom, experimental backend architecture.  

- [**Ook**](https://git.sr.ht/~milobanks/ook) ([GitHub Mirror](https://github.com/milobanks/ook))  
  An investigative object-oriented kernel, written in C++.  

- [**SCVS**](https://git.sr.ht/~milobanks/scvs) ([GitHub Mirror](https://github.com/milobanks/scvs))  
  A modernization effort for the SCVS version control system, writen in Perl.
